Alena Whitlock

Questions: What are at least 3 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
My first isssue was my flask and the upgrade of windows 11. I had a werid situation were some of my project wasn't responding. I had to uninstall it and redownload it agagin. 
My second issue was trying to have the input into a database. It would said it was accepted but wasnt recorded. Then I had another issue were it was recorded but I couldnt not find it any more. I need to try to be orgainze. 
My third problem was a lot of problems with my personal computer. I dont understand why I had to google my problems and ask classmate for help. It was solve but thats one of my issue. Little issue on the database.

What would you do to improve your project in the future? 
Its has a choppy look. It doesn't look like a nice webstie, it looks like and old websites in the early 2000s. It need to look like a more upscale website with a finish look. I like working with the html part of the project and want to work on that.


How did your experience working on this milestone differ from what you pictured while working through the planning process? What was unexpectedly hard? Was anything unexpectedly easy?
It was pretty hard for me since I had to catch up with class. Sadly, it was a little bit hard for me. I think both Milestone 1 and Mileston 2 was had there moments were I have to figure out what I need to do or panic were I couldn't figure out a error. It shows me that you have to have good sense of problem solving.
